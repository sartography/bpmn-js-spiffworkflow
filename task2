The issue in the app/spiffworkflow/extensions/propertiesPanel/ExtensionsPropertiesProvider.jsx file is that four features (createBusinessRuleGroup, createUserInstructionsGroup, createAllowGuestGroup, and createUserGroup) do not result in black dots showing when things are changed.

import {
  CheckboxEntry,
  isCheckboxEntryEdited,
  TextAreaEntry,
  isTextAreaEntryEdited,
  SelectEntry,
  isSelectEntryEdited,
  SimpleEntry,
  isSimpleEntryEdited,
} from '@bpmn-io/properties-panel';

And then update each group to include the appropriate isEdited function:
