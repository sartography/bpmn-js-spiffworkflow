Properties Panel - Instruction is missing non-null indication marker (black dot)

Reproduction

add a proces
edit end event*)
add random text to 'element documentation'
result: black dot appears behind this property
add random text to 'instructions'
result: black dot will not appear behind this property
*) or any element with an 'instructions' property

The title tag on the black dot is "Section contains data." It looks like you use an isEdited function to indicate whether or not the section has been edited, but this needs to be applied to our custom instructions group.

test_instructions_black_dot.py is currently reproducing the bug.
isEdited is currently hardcoded to true, but it maybe needs to be a function that always returns true, because i just want to see the black dot. See also the second entry in ExtensionsPropertiesProvider.jsx

Uncaught (in promise) ReferenceError: isTextFieldEntryEdited is not defined
