The issue in the app/spiffworkflow/extensions/propertiesPanel/ExtensionsPropertiesProvider.jsx file is that four features (createBusinessRuleGroup, createUserInstructionsGroup, createAllowGuestGroup, and createUserGroup) do not result in black dots showing when things are changed.
However, preScriptPostScriptGroup does show the black dots correctly.

possible key differences:
1. commandStack.execute('element.updateModdleProperties' only seems to be fired by the preScriptPostScriptGroup, but not any of the broken features, so that might help explain the issue.
2. isEdited, when removed from the working preScriptPostScriptGroup function, does indeed break the black dot functionality, so that might be a key difference as well.

maybe try applying both of these.
There is a unit test at test_instructions_black_dot.py that demonstrates the difference, but the reason for the bug must be in app/spiffworkflow/extensions/propertiesPanel/ExtensionsPropertiesProvider.jsx

here are some of the other functions from the lib, since isTextFieldEntryEdited is not the only relevant isEdited function, and some of these others might also need to be imported.

 ~/projects/github/properties-panel | main > rg export.*default.*isEdited
src/components/entries/index.js
1:export { default as CheckboxEntry, isEdited as isCheckboxEntryEdited } from './Checkbox';
13:export { default as TemplatingEntry, isEdited as isTemplatingEntryEdited } from './templating';
15:export { default as NumberFieldEntry, isEdited as isNumberFieldEntryEdited } from './NumberField';
