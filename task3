The issue in the app/spiffworkflow/extensions/propertiesPanel/ExtensionsPropertiesProvider.jsx file is that four features (createBusinessRuleGroup, createUserInstructionsGroup, createAllowGuestGroup, and createUserGroup) do not result in black dots showing when things are changed.
However, preScriptPostScriptGroup does show the black dots correctly.
commandStack.execute('element.updateModdleProperties' only seems to be fired by the preScriptPostScriptGroup, but not any of the broken features, so that might help explain the issue.
isEdited, when removed from the working preScriptPostScriptGroup function, does indeed break the black dot functionality, so that might be a key difference as well.
There is a unit test at test_instructions_black_dot.py that demonstrates the difference, but the reason for the bug must be in app/spiffworkflow/extensions/propertiesPanel/ExtensionsPropertiesProvider.jsx
