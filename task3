The issue in the app/spiffworkflow/extensions/propertiesPanel/ExtensionsPropertiesProvider.jsx file is that four features (createBusinessRuleGroup, createUserInstructionsGroup, createAllowGuestGroup, and createUserGroup) do not result in black dots showing when things are changed.
However, preScriptPostScriptGroup does show the black dots correctly.
What could explain this difference?
There is a unit test at test_instructions_black_dot.py that demonstrates the difference, but the reason for the bug must be in app/spiffworkflow/extensions/propertiesPanel/ExtensionsPropertiesProvider.jsx
Can you spot it?
